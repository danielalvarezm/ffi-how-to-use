# FFI/FFIGEN HOW TO USE EXAMPLE

This repository is an example of how to integrate a C project into your Dart/Flutter project using [ffi](https://pub.dev/packages/ffi) and [ffigen](https://pub.dev/packages/ffigen) Dart packages.

In this case, a C project has been created with a library containing a function that multiplies two numbers. This library is used in a Dart project (it would also work for Flutter) to display the result of the multiplication in the console.

## Getting started
* Install [taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) to automate processes. If you don't want to use it, you can run the commands in the [Taskfile.yaml](https://github.com/danielalvarezm/ffi-how-to-use/blob/main/Taskfile.yaml) file manually.
* Install [ffigen](https://pub.dev/packages/ffigen#installing-llvm) dependencies.
* Install project dependencies with `dart pub get`.
* You should have everything you need to compile and run a C project. If not, install the necessary dependencies (Cmake, gcc, etc).
* Run `task generate` to generate all dependencies and bindings needed. This includes:
    *  `dart pub get`: Install dart dependencies
    * `task build`: Generate C shared library, dependencies and executable 
    * `task ffigen`: Generate dart code with ffigen from C lang
* Run `task execute` or `task run` (generate + execute) to run the example.

>ðŸ’¡ All task commands have to be run from the root folder of the project.
